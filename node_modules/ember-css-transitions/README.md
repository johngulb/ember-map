# Ember CSS Transitions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peec/ember-css-transitions.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/peec/ember-css-transitions.svg) [![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-css-transitions.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-css-transitions)

This addon provides a nice way of defining CSS Transitions for Ember Components. Which means, only css based animations for performance - and no animation library needed.

Ember CSS Transitions is heavily inspired (and CSS compatible) with:

- [React's CSS Transitions](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) (the implementation is mostly based on React)
- [Angular's CSS Transitions](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate)

Animations are completely based on CSS classes. As long as you have a CSS class attached to a HTML element, you can apply animations to it.


## Documentation

- [http://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/](http://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/)

## How it works

**Utimately you define your animations and transitions with ONLY CSS.**

```css
.example-enter {
  opacity: 0.01;
}

.example-enter.example-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity .5s ease-in;
}
.example-leave {
  opacity: 1;
}

.example-leave.example-leave-active {
  opacity: 0.01;
  transition: opacity .5s ease-in;
}
```

### Animating insert and destroy

There are two ways of defining enter/leave transitions,
If you use the `{{transition-group}}` component you can then do something like this ( there is also a mixin you can use for custom components):

```handlebars
{{#if shouldShowThis}}
  {{#transition-group transitionName="example"}}
    This is animated in.
  {{/transition-group}}
{{/if}}
```

`ember-css-transitions` will automatically manage the lifecycle of the css classes applied so that it makes the animation on `didInsertElement` and `willDestroyElement`.
It adds `yourclass-enter` suffix and `yourclass-enter-active` when `didInsertElement` is applied. The same happens in `willDestroyElement` using `yourclass-leave` and `yourclass-leave-active`.

### Animating class add/removal

Apart from the insert/destroy hooks for transitions, there is also an optional `transitionClassNameBindings` array
that has the same syntax as `classNameBindings`, but also adds `*-add`, `*-add-active`, `*-remove` and `*-remove-active` to the
classes that you specify based on their transition time.

```js
transitionClassNameBindings: ['isOpen', 'pinned:is-pinned']
```

The above example will add the other classes for the two base classes, i.e. `.is-open` and `.is-pinned`.

## Install

Run:

```
ember install ember-css-transitions

```

**Note** Installing ember-cli-autoprefixer is suggested for CSS transitions:

```
ember install ember-cli-autoprefixer
```

## Tested in the following browsers / platforms:

- [x] IE 10
- [x] IE 11
- [x] Microsoft Edge
- [x] Chrome
- [x] Firefox
- [x] Safari
- [x] Android
- [x] iPhone

Note: **IE9** does not support CSS3 transitions / animations. They must live with no animations / transitions.
